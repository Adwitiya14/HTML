<h2>About myself</h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Adwitiya Naha. I recently graduated from school and have now stepped into an exciting new chapter of my academic journey as a Computer Science and Engineering student at Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology. </p>
<p>Although I studied Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Biology (PCMB) in school, my curiosity for technology and programming has always been strong. Without having Computer Science as a subject in school, I’ve built my interest from scratch—and that has made me even more eager to learn.</p>
<p>I consider myself a knowledge-hungry learner, especially when it comes to coding, web development, and exploring new programming languages. Every concept I come across feels like a stepping stone toward building something impactful, and I’m always looking forward to broadening my understanding of computer science</p>
